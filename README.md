## Introduction
In this project, we aim to perform binary image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify metastatic cancer in histopathologic images. The dataset used is derived from the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset, providing a straightforward yet clinically relevant task.

## Problem Analysis
### What is the Problem and Its Impact on Industry?
The problem we are addressing is detecting metastatic cancer in histopathologic images. Accurate and efficient detection of cancerous tissues is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment, significantly impacting patient outcomes.

### Machine Learning Model and Rationale
For this project, we will use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are highly effective in image classification tasks. CNNs can automatically learn and extract features from images, making them suitable for identifying patterns in medical images.

### Expected Outcome
The expected outcome is to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify image patches as either cancerous or non-cancerous. This model will assist pathologists in diagnosing cancer, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of cancer detection.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ðŸ“Š

### 1. Load the Data

We begin by loading the necessary libraries and the dataset. The labels for the training images are loaded from the `labels.csv` file.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from PIL import Image
import os

# Load the labels
labels_df = pd.read_csv('train/_labels.csv')
labels_df.head()
```

### 2. Data Cleaning

We check for any missing values in the labels dataframe and handle them if necessary. Fortunately, there are no missing values in our dataset.

```python
# Check for missing values and drop it
print(labels_df.isnull().sum())

labels_df.dropna(inplace=True)
```

### 3. Data Distribution Analysis

Next, we visualize the distribution of the labels to understand the balance of the dataset. The dataset contains a higher number of non-cancerous images compared to cancerous ones.

```python
# Plot the distribution of labels
sns.countplot(x='label', data=labels_df)
plt.title('Distribution of Labels')
plt.show()
```

![Distribution of Labels](./images/distribution_of_labels.png)

### 4. Sample Images

We load and display a few sample images from the dataset to get an idea of what the data looks like. Below are sample images for both classes (0: non-cancerous, 1: cancerous).

#### Sample Images with Label 0

```python
# Function to load and display sample images
def display_sample_images(image_ids, label):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
    for i, image_id in enumerate(image_ids):
        image_path = f'train/{image_id}.tif'
        image = Image.open(image_path)
        plt.subplot(3, 3, i + 1)
        plt.imshow(image)
        plt.title(f'Label: {label}')
        plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

sample_image_ids_0 = labels_df[labels_df['label'] == 0].sample(9)['id'].values
display_sample_images(sample_image_ids_0, label=0)
```

![Sample Images Label 0](./images/sample_images_label_0.png) 

#### Sample Images with Label 1

```python
# Display sample images with label 1
sample_image_ids_1 = labels_df[labels_df['label'] == 1].sample(9)['id'].values
display_sample_images(sample_image_ids_1, label=1)
```

![Sample Images Label 1](./images/sample_images_label_1.png) 

### 5. Data Cleaning Procedures

We ensure that all images are of the same size (96x96 pixels) and RGB format. This step confirms the consistency of the image data.

```python
# Check the size and mode of a few sample images
def check_image_properties(image_ids):
    for image_id in image_ids:
        image_path = f'train/{image_id}.tif'
        image = Image.open(image_path)
        print(f'Image ID: {image_id}, Size: {image.size}, Mode: {image.mode}')

# We check a few properties of a few sample images
sample_image_ids = labels_df['id'].sample(5).values
check_image_properties(sample_image_ids)
```
## Model Training and Evaluation ðŸ§ 

### Model Architecture

In this step, we design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify metastatic cancer in histopathologic images. The CNN is chosen due to its ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features, making it highly effective for image classification tasks, particularly in medical imaging.

Here is the detailed breakdown of our model architecture, and some data manipulation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd
from PIL import Image

# Load the labels
labels_df = pd.read_csv('train/_labels.csv')

# Change data types to string
labels_df['id'] = labels_df['id'] + '.tif'
labels_df['label'] = labels_df['label'].astype(str)

# Split the data into training and validation sets
train_df, valid_df = train_test_split(labels_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Now we will configure data generators for training and validation using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator`. It first sets up the training data generator with various augmentations like rescaling, rotation, shifting, shearing, and flipping to enhance the model's robustness. Then, it creates a validation data generator with only rescaling. The `flow_from_dataframe` method is used to generate batches of augmented/normalized data from the provided dataframes (`train_df` and `valid_df`), specifying the image directory, target size, batch size, and class mode. This setup helps efficiently manage and preprocess the large dataset during model training.

```python
# Define ImageDataGenerators
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

valid_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

# Create data generators
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=train_df,
    directory='train',
    x_col='id',
    y_col='label',
    target_size=(96, 96),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary',
    shuffle=True
)

valid_generator = valid_datagen.flow_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=valid_df,
    directory='train',
    x_col='id',
    y_col='label',
    target_size=(96, 96),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary',
    shuffle=False
)
```

Now let's start by importing the necessary layers from TensorFlow's Keras module. These layers include convolutional, pooling, and normalization layers, which are essential for building our CNN.

```python
# Define the model
model = Sequential()
```

We initialize a Sequential model, which is a linear stack of layers.

```python
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(96, 96, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
```

- **Conv2D Layer**: The first layer is a convolutional layer with 32 filters, each of size 3x3. This layer is responsible for extracting features from the input images. We use the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity.
- **MaxPooling2D Layer**: This layer reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the feature maps by a factor of 2, which helps in reducing the computational cost and the risk of overfitting.
- **BatchNormalization Layer**: Batch normalization is applied to stabilize and accelerate the training process.

```python
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
```

The second set of convolutional, pooling, and normalization layers follows the same pattern but increases the number of filters to 64, allowing the model to learn more complex features.

```python
model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
```

The third set of layers further increases the number of filters to 128, enabling the model to capture even more detailed features.

```python
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
```

- **Flatten Layer**: This layer flattens the 3D feature maps to 1D feature vectors, preparing the data for the dense layers.
- **Dense Layer**: A dense (fully connected) layer with 512 units and ReLU activation is added to learn from the features extracted by the convolutional layers.
- **Dropout Layer**: Dropout is applied with a rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting by randomly setting half of the input units to zero during training.
- **Output Layer**: The final dense layer with a single unit and sigmoid activation function is used to produce the binary classification output (cancerous or non-cancerous).

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

We compile the model using the Adam optimizer, which adjusts the learning rate during training. The loss function used is binary cross-entropy, suitable for binary classification tasks, and we track the modelâ€™s accuracy.

## Training the Model

Next, we train the model using the training data and validate its performance on the validation set.

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=len(train_generator),
    validation_data=valid_generator,
    validation_steps=len(valid_generator),
    epochs=10
)
```

We use the `ImageDataGenerator` to handle image loading and augmentation on-the-fly, which helps in efficiently managing memory and enhancing the robustness of the model by augmenting the images during training.

- **steps_per_epoch**: This parameter defines the total number of steps (batches of samples) to draw from the generator before declaring one epoch finished and starting the next epoch.
- **validation_data**: The validation data is used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance after each epoch.
- **epochs**: We train the model for 10 epochs, balancing between training time and performance improvement.

Finally, we save the trained model for future use.

```python
# Save the model
model.save('cancer_detection_model.h5')
```

This step ensures that we can reuse the trained model for predictions without retraining.

### Model Training and Evaluation ðŸ“¦

In this step, we fine-tune our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by experimenting with different hyperparameters, architectures, and techniques to improve training performance. The goal is to identify the optimal configuration that maximizes our model's accuracy in detecting metastatic cancer in histopathologic images.

## Data Preparation and Generators

We begin by preparing our dataset and defining data generators for efficient training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os
from PIL import Image
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

# Load the labels
labels_df = pd.read_csv('train/_labels.csv')
labels_df['id'] = labels_df['id'] + '.tif'
labels_df['label'] = labels_df['label'].astype(str)

# Split the data into training and validation sets
train_df, valid_df = train_test_split(labels_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
*We load the labels, append the `.tif` extension to each `id` to match the filenames, and convert labels to strings. The dataset is then split into training and validation sets.*

```python
# Use a smaller subset of the dataset for quick hyperparameter tuning
small_train_df = train_df.sample(frac=0.1, random_state=42)  # Use 10% of the training data
small_valid_df = valid_df.sample(frac=0.1, random_state=42)  # Use 10% of the validation data
```
*We create smaller subsets of the training and validation datasets for quicker hyperparameter tuning.*

```python
# Define ImageDataGenerators
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

valid_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
```
*ImageDataGenerators are defined for augmenting the training data and rescaling the validation data.*

```python
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=train_df,
    directory='train',
    x_col='id',
    y_col='label',
    target_size=(96, 96),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary',
    shuffle=True
)

valid_generator = valid_datagen.flow_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=valid_df,
    directory='train',
    x_col='id',
    y_col='label',
    target_size=(96, 96),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary',
    shuffle=False
)

small_train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=small_train_df,
    directory='train',
    x_col='id',
    y_col='label',
    target_size=(96, 96),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary',
    shuffle=True
)

small_valid_generator = valid_datagen.flow_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=small_valid_df,
    directory='train',
    x_col='id',
    y_col='label',
    target_size=(96, 96),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary',
    shuffle=False
)
```
*We create data generators for both the full and smaller datasets, enabling efficient loading and preprocessing of images during model training.*

## Initial Model Architecture

We define our initial CNN model as a baseline for further tuning.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the last model created in the last step
initial_model = load_model('cancer_detection_model.h5')

```
*We build and train our initial model using convolutional, max-pooling, and batch normalization layers, followed by dense and dropout layers. This initial training helps establish a baseline for comparison.*

## Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Comparison

We experiment with different numbers of filters and dropout rates to identify the best model configuration.

```python
# Hyperparameter tuning and Model Comparison
def build_model(num_filters, dropout_rate):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(num_filters, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(96, 96, 3)))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(BatchNormalization())

    model.add(Conv2D(num_filters * 2, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(BatchNormalization())

    model.add(Conv2D(num_filters * 4, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(BatchNormalization())

    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(dropout_rate))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Early stopping
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3, restore_best_weights=True)

# Hyperparameter options
num_filters_options = [32, 64]
dropout_rate_options = [0.3, 0.5]
initial_epochs = 5

best_val_accuracy = 0
best_model = None

for num_filters in num_filters_options:
    for dropout_rate in dropout_rate_options:
        model = build_model(num_filters, dropout_rate)
        history = model.fit(
            small_train_generator,
            steps_per_epoch=len(small_train_generator),
            validation_data=small_valid_generator,
            validation_steps=len(small_valid_generator),
            epochs=initial_epochs,
            callbacks=[early_stopping]
        )
        val_accuracy = max(history.history['val_accuracy'])
        if val_accuracy > best_val_accuracy:
            best_val_accuracy = val_accuracy
            best_model = model
```
*We define a model-building function that varies the number of filters and dropout rates. Using early stopping, we train the models on the smaller dataset to quickly identify promising configurations.*

## Transfer Learning Model

We use a pre-trained VGG16 model to leverage transfer learning for potentially better performance and faster convergence.

```python
# Transfer Learning Model
def build_transfer_model(dropout_rate, weights_path):
    base_model = VGG16(weights=weights_path, include_top=False, input_shape=(96, 96, 3))
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(base_model)
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(dropout_rate))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

    for layer in base_model.layers:
        layer.trainable = False

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Specify the path to the downloaded weights file
weights_path = 'vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5'

for dropout_rate in dropout_rate_options:
    model = build_transfer_model(dropout_rate, weights_path)
    history = model.fit(
        small_train_generator,
        steps_per_epoch=len(small_train_generator),
        validation_data=small_valid_generator,
        validation_steps=len(small_valid_generator),
        epochs=initial_epochs,
        callbacks=[early_stopping]
    )
    val_accuracy = max(history.history['val_accuracy'])
    if val_accuracy > best_val_accuracy:
        best_val_accuracy = val_accuracy
        best_model = model
```
*We define a transfer learning model using the VGG16 architecture. The pre-trained model's layers are frozen, and additional dense and dropout layers are added for fine-tuning.*

## Saving the Best Model

The best-performing model is saved for future use.

```python
best_model.save('best_cancer_detection_model.h5')
```
*We save the best model identified during hyperparameter tuning and model comparison.*

## Discussion of Results

In this section, we analyze the results from the different models and hyperparameter tuning efforts. Our objective is to compare the performance of the original CNN architecture, models with different hyperparameters, and transfer learning models. We use accuracy and loss metrics for this comparison. Additionally, we had to shorten our testing sizes due to computational constraints.

### Original Model Architecture

The original model architecture, as seen in the provided image, includes several convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, batch normalization layers, and dense layers. This architecture forms the baseline for our comparisons.

#### Accuracy and Loss Plots

![Plots of Results](./images/drplot.png)
This illustrates the training and validation accuracy and loss over five epochs for both the original model and the transfer learning model. The transfer learning model consistently shows higher training and validation accuracy compared to the original model, indicating better performance and generalization. The original modelâ€™s validation accuracy declines significantly after the third epoch, suggesting overfitting, while the transfer learning model maintains a stable and high validation accuracy. Similarly, in the loss plots, the transfer learning model demonstrates lower and more stable training and validation loss, reflecting its ability to learn more effectively from the data and avoid overfitting issues that the original model encounters. This highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning in improving model performance on this task.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we aim to perform binary image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify metastatic cancer in histopathologic images. The dataset used is derived from the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset, providing a straightforward yet clinically relevant task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Analysis\n",
    "### What is the Problem and Its Impact on Industry?\n",
    "The problem we are addressing is detecting metastatic cancer in histopathologic images. Accurate and efficient detection of cancerous tissues is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment, significantly impacting patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Model and Rationale\n",
    "For this project, we will use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are highly effective in image classification tasks. CNNs can automatically learn and extract features from images, making them suitable for identifying patterns in medical images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcome\n",
    "The expected outcome is to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify image patches as either cancerous or non-cancerous. This model will assist pathologists in diagnosing cancer, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of cancer detection.\n",
